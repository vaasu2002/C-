/*
LINEAR SEARCH

You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N, and an integer X. You need to search for the integer X in the given array/list using 'Linear Search'.
 You have been required to return the index at which X is present in the array/list. If X has multiple occurrences in the array/list, then you need to return the index at which the first occurrence of X would be encountered. In case X is not present in the array/list, then return -1.
'Linear search' is a method for finding an element within an array/list. It sequentially checks each element of the array/list until a match is found or the whole array/list has been searched.
